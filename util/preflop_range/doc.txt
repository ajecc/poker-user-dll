Positions, in order: UTG, HJ, CO, BTN, SB, BB

There are 4 scenarios present preflop:  # TODO: maybe add squeeze
	- open (does not include a BB range)
        - "There has been no action in front of you and you're the first player to act"
		- file_format: {hero_pos}_Open.html
	- facing a raise
        - "A player in front of you has raised to 3BB"
        - might not be optimal for other betting sizes (2.5BB, 4BB) or when multiple players call the raising opponent
		- file_format: {hero_pos}_{villain_pos}_Facing_Raise.html, where hero_pos < villain_pos (e.g. BTN < HJ)
	- facing a 3bet after my raise
        - "You acted first raising to 2.5BB, and a player has decided to pot-sized re-raise (3bet) behind you"
        - if the player bets more than pot, it could be advisable to use the 4bet range here, even tho the player has not been 4betted
		- file_format: {hero_pos}_{villain_pos}_Facing_3bet.html, where hero_pos > villain_pos (e.g. HJ > BTN)
	- facing a 4bet after my raise:
        - "A player in front of you does an initial raise to 3BB. You do a pot-sized re-raise (3bet), and he reacts by re-raising (4betting) again pot size"
        - might consider this range even tho the villain shoved or raised less than pot size
        - raise here from the hero = all in 
		- file_format: {hero_pos}_{villain_pos}_Facing_4bet.html, where herpo_pos < villain_pos

All of these are aproximate, as 6max NLHE has not been solved yet for preflop 


################################## CSV ##################################
The csv directory contains the preflop ranges converted to csv for convinience.

Each row has 3 columns: 
    - the hand (e.g AKs = Ace King suited, 67o = 6 7 off-suit)
    - the action
        - 'F' = fold
        - 'C' = call
        - 'R' = raise
    - the raise probability
        - this row indicates the percentage the hero should raise instead of doing the action indicated in the second row

The pair of hands that are not in the csv are an automatic fold. There is no need to include them.
